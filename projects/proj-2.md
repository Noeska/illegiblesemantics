title: 'Logo Samples'
---
Here you can see samples of logo designs covering a broad range of metal genres and extreme subgenres with some tongue-in-cheek commentary by Gerrit Rijken. 




# Heavy Metal
I struggled to find a quintessential example of a pure, heavy metal rock logo that I could use as inspiration, because these types of logos are kinda all over the place style-wise, from rough, sketchy logos (Skid Row) to type-only (or type-like) logos (Whitesnake) that have a "Saturday-morning cartoon" feel to them (Winger) -- which I do not mean in a pejorative sense. 

But I'd say generally, as opposed to other the (sub)genres that we discuss in the paper, Heavy Metal logos take their cues from **biker aesthetics** and have a **blocky feel to them**. They're also often **colorful in terms of hues and tinges**.

## NWOBHM
With respect to the New Wave of British Heavy Metal<sup>1</sup>, a rather specific subset of Heavy Metal that emerged, as the name already denotes, in the United Kingdom, the above also applies here. 

Here, I purposely decided to do a logo in the vein of Judas Priest's logo -- well, one of them at least --, because I felt it'd make for an interesting comparison with specifically Teutonic Thrash Metal logos, which can be found further down. The key words here: **industrial**, **tight**, and **laser-like**.

#### Speed Metal
Speed Metal has its roots in NWOBHM and would lay the lay the foundation for later extreme metal genres. As the the name already suggests, it's all about speed. In this it is much like Thrash Metal -- which is probably why Speed logos can easily be mistaken for Thrash logos --, but it's lyrically less abrasive and musically more melodic. So what sets these apart from the rest? I'd say these logos, more than others, convey a visual sense of speed, which is why often the letters are designed in a **cursive style** and **drawn together**, or if not that at least **packed closely together**.

![Speed Metal](..\assets\img\projects\proj-2\speed.png)

#### Power Metal
Power Metal takes its inspiration from both traditional Heavy Metal and Speed Metal and fuses this with theatrics and bombast in an effort to create something emotionally impactful and powerful. (More often, however, the result is *bathos*. But that's just me talking.) This may be why Power logos are often **rendered in full 3D**, with a **metallic** or **stony texture**. Because, you know, Power Metal is that deep and powerful! Like metal or stone!

# Thrash Metal
Abrasive. Loud. Extremely fast yet still precise, with impeccable sense of timing. If judging by these words alone, it may sound like I'm describing a Dutch olympian -- a speed skater or a cyclist, perhaps. But we're talking music, aren't we? I'm talking Thrash Metal, of course, which means I'm talking yet another extreme subgenre of Heavy Metal. And yes, Thrash Metal has its own aesthetics, too. Generally speaking, Thrash logos tend to have **straight, sharp edges** which reflect the tightness and controlled nature of the music's rhythms.<sup>2</sup> Indeed, some exceptions aside, there is no softness to be found in them whatsoever -- there is only hardness.

## U.S. Thrash Metal
<!--In the U.S., Thrash Metal emerged against the backdrop of Reagan conservatism and the concurrent emergence and rise in popularity of the more mainstream friendly Glam Metal genre. This context proved extremely fertile ground for a new kind of sound, and for some reason especially in California, especially in the San Francisco Bay Area. 

It is important to stress here that this is not a hard-and-fast rule for U.S. Thrash aesthetics. Ed Repka, an American graphic artist, for example, has been an instrumental figure in definining said aesthetics. 

And what's really interesting here is that the aesthetics of the Bay Area scene was characterized by a "do-it-yourself" ethos, as opposed to the Metal bands of yore who often used already established fonts.<sup>2</sup> 

##### Billboard, 14. apr. 2004, p. 24
For logos, many bands within the Bay Area scene had a more "do it yourself"-artistic approach[32] compared to the older metal bands using an already established font.

The logo below was based on Dark Angel's logo. Though technically not a band from the Bay Area -- though still from California -- , I feel their logo captures best the look of the U.S. Thrash genre. -->

It can be difficult to differentiate between a U.S. Thrash band and a German one; perhaps the only clue is that U.S. Thrash are more likely to have a hint or element of **symmetry** to them. Come to think of it, they may also have more likelihood of having an **outline** or **"halo"** surrounding the the letters. 
![Thrash Metal](..\assets\img\projects\proj-2\thrash.jpg)

#### Bay Area Thrash Metal
If we are to distinguish further among U.S. Thrash Metal bands and we continue differentiating, then the early-1980s San Francisco Bay Area scene surely deserves some attention from everyone! What's interesting here is that the aesthetics of said scene were largely characterized by a "do-it-yourself" ethos, as opposed to the aesthetics of the then already established Metal bands who often used established fonts for their logos (see **Iron Maiden**, for example). Arguably the most famous example of this is **Metallica**'s logo which was drawn up by none other than James Hetfield himself. This may be why certain U.S. Thrash logos, or part of these logos, **look a bit off**; because they were not always done by trained graphical designers who are familiar with rulers and with drawing and measuring segments.

Another thing to point out here is that in Bay Area Thrash logos you can often find a **juxtaposition of straight lines with round shapes** or **straight lines against curved lines**. To refer back to the example of Metallica's logo, the C is rounded, but the first and last letters are sharp and italicized. 

## Teutonic Thrash Metal 
As a genre, Teutonic Thrash Metal has a distinct German character, and a few notable exceptions aside, this is reflected in the kind of logos bands in this genre have. Like 1980s U.S. Thrash logos, Teutonic Thrash logos are **extremely angular, wth fixed angles**, but with way **less emphasis on symmetry**, and the letters are generally **more blocky in shape**. With this, they seem to be saying, "We believe in substance over style, and function over form." Which is all fine and dandy until you try to put a cube through a round hole. It's probably why you've never heard of **Kreator** ... while you no doubt own a copy of the **"Black"** album.

![Teutonic Thrash Metal](..\assets\img\projects\proj-2\teutonic.jpg)

# Death Metal
Death Metal at large is one of the major "mainstream" modes of extreme metal. It's typically characterized by low-tuned, heavily distorted guitars, aggressive, thumping drumming (featuring double-kicks and blast-beats), deep growling vocals, abrupt and complex changes in tempo and time signature ... As a genre, it is very broad, encompassing a great deal of diversity. Indeed, it has spawned several subgenres since its inception in the mid- to late-1980s, all with their own specific iconography. Here I will be covering only some of them. 

As a general rule it can be observed that in this genre the letters making up the logos tend to be **thick** and **bold** as opposed to, say, the letters making up Black Metal logos. They latter tend to be thin and sometimes somewhat shaky. And, contrary to Thrash logos, Death logos tend to have more **"soft" elements**.

## Brutal Death Metal
Brutal Death Metal emerged most notably from the 1980s New York Hardcore movement. It's characterized by its thumping heaviness, high-speed power chording and riffing, and overall complex rhythms. As a rule, their lyrics deal with slasher movies and True Crime, and this is often reflected in their choice of logos. These typically incorporate **gore elements** (e.g., bones, intestines, and blood), sometimes to the point where the entire logo exactly resembles like a jigsaw puzzle of bones dripping blood. 
![Brutal Death Metal](..\assets\img\projects\proj-2\death.jpg)

#### Florida Death Metal
When it comes to Death Metal, the Florida Death Metal scene deserves some special attention. Here the bands that emerged in the late-1980s were not so much inspired by the Hardcore movement but rather built on the musical formula established by the early-1980s Thrash Metal and the first wave of Black Metal bands. These Florida bands were also lyrically more inspired, expressly refined, dealing with more abstract concepts such as religion, enlightenment, and ecology. In terms of logo-design, it's hard to pinpoint specific characteristics. But I'd say they tend to have a "tattoo-like" quality to them (think here of **tribal flames** with their scythe-like edges or 1950s-style **hotrod flames**).
![Brutal Death Metal](..\assets\img\projects\proj-2\brutal.jpg)

## Death-Doom 
This extreme subgenre was originally inspired by and birthed out of the (crust-)punk scene of the 1980s, most notably but not exclusively in Stockholm, Sweden. It combines the slow tempos and pessimistic, or merely depressive, melodies of Doom Metal with the low, grunting vocals of Death Metal. Typically, a Death-Doom logo is basically a **blackletter(-like) wordmark** (i.e., a type-only logo) surrounded with a **white, sometimes jaggy, halo**. 

![Swedish Doom-Death Metal](..\assets\img\projects\proj-2\swedish.jpg)

## Melodic Death Metal
Melodic Death Metal was arguably first pioneered in the United Kingdom, but the genre really came into its own in Sweden, specifically in Gothenburg. As a genre, it took its inspiration from a wide range of styles, from Death Metal to NWOBHM to Progressive Rock, with certain elements from these reference styles more predominant in one band's music than another's, which may help explain why it is difficult to think of a quintessential Melodic Death logo. 

Initially, indeed, in the early 1990s, Melodic Death logos were very diverse in style, with some (seemingly) taking their inspiration from "mainstream" Death Metal logos (In Flames), others had intricate custom designs (At the Gates), while still others opted for a distorted and deformed Celtic type (Dark Tranquility). In later and more recent years, however, most bands in this genre have **highly-readable wordmarks** that are sometimes "touched up" or "filled in" with a **dirt brush**.
![Melodic Death Metal](..\assets\img\projects\proj-2\gothenburg.jpg)

## Technical Death Metal
#### 1990s 
A hard-and-fast rule in Death Metal aesthetics is that the more technical the music, the less sophisticated the logo. This is exemplified in Technical Death Metal, a genre whose artists mix "fast, virtuosic guitar riffs and solos of varying tempos and time signature changes with prevalent drumming and frequent blast beats."<sup>3</sup> It's usually easy to recognize bands playing in this genre. They often have what **looks like a Black Metal logo**, except it's not -- it's **not nearly as sophisticated**.
![Technical Death Metal](..\assets\img\projects\proj-2\tech90.jpg)
If they're still active to this day, they now probably have a **type-only logo**, one that is most likely **superimposed** over an earlier "Black Metal-like" logo.
![Technical Death Metal](..\assets\img\projects\proj-2\tech901.jpg)
##### [3] Simon Poole, 'M. Unger, *Sound, Symbol, Sociality: The Aesthetic Experience of Extreme Metal Music*, 20.

#### Post-2000s
It's fairly easy to recognize a post-2000s Technical Death band from a 1990s band in the same genre. For some reason wholly unknown to me, the former is likely to have a logo that they proudly put on their shirts -- even though it doesn't really look good. It's always like these logos were done by a novice who played with **Illustrator** and who is not quite familiar yet with Illustrator's **Pen tool**. The result inevitably is that all these logos have a **"Bézier" look** to them; and this is the reason they *never* look good. 

![Technical Death Metal](..\assets\img\projects\proj-2\tech00.jpg)

## Progressive Metal
What does "Progressive" mean in the context of Extreme Metal? Who knows? I sure as hell don't. It could mean anything from "We brought in a saxophonist to record a Metal album with us" to a more general "We march to our own beat" -- which is often to be taken literally: Progressive bands seem to have a weird thing for *syncopation*. The question then is how to best represent this visually? It may seem daunting but it is actually quite easy: (1.) the letters need to be **tight and bold** and (2.) the letters need to be **missing parts**, because this says something about the band's music: "Our music is tight and bold! And it's often difficult to follow and may even end abruptly."
![Progressive Metal](..\assets\img\projects\proj-2\progressive.jpg)

# Grindcore
Grindcore fuses elements of Heavy Metal with Punk Hardcore, creating a negative synergy where one plus one arguably equals less than two. No wonder, then, that Grindcore logos look **crude and unfinished** at best. But all is not bad either, for great (to some) is the genre's fondness for puerile humor and disgusting aesthetics, with visual **references to scathology and other bodily functions**. In short, think of Grindcore aesthetics as the typographic equivalent of a schoolboy's fantasies. This may also help explain the heavy usage of **color and texture**. (Kids love color. Right? I wouldn't know, I'm not a father.)
![Grindcore](..\assets\img\projects\proj-2\grind.jpg)


# Black Metal
Black Metal is one of the more extreme subgenres of Heavy Metal music, not just in terms of music but equally in terms of commitment and attitude. Very early since its inception, artists and fans alike have taken things to extremes, committing acts of self-maiming, suicide, arson, grave-robbing, and in some cases even murder; though these days it's really just another music genre that's out there. 

While there are many subgenres of Black Metal, they all, or most of them, share common traits. These include fast tempos, shrieking vocals, heavily distorted guitars, lo-fi recording, and a strong emphasis on atmosphere. 

Lyrically and thematically, songs often deal with the occult, Satanism, and diabolic perversion. Sometimes, it's about following the "left-hand path" rather than the "right-hand way;" sometimes it's just plain raging against religion, or at least Christianity. Other times, it's about exploring Nietzsche's Zarathustra; still other times, it's about black crows on a tombstone.  

In the mid-1980s, and especially in the early 1990s, there were created a few logos that proved seminal in the years to come, most notably the logos of Mayhem and Emperor. Basically, every Black Metal logo created now takes its cues from both of these. Which is why, regardless of subgenre, Black Metal logos tend to look alike. Indeed, they all share a couple of logo and letter design traits: 

1. The logos often display a **high degree of symmetry**; 
![Black Metal](..\assets\img\projects\proj-2\black2.jpg)
2. The logos often feature either **abstract Satanic, occult, or anti-Christian imagery** (inverted crosses, pentagrams, demon and magick sigils) or **figurative graphics pertaining to the dark arts** (candles, wolf heads, goat heads, dragons, daggers, crescents moons) or sometimes both;
![Black Metal](..\assets\img\projects\proj-2\black4.jpg)
3. The letters are often in **blackletter(-like) form**, either in lowercase or uppercase, with **flourishes (curls and spikes)** and **exaggerated edges**; <!-- Flourishes and exaggerated are commonplace, "with extaneous strokes running parallel, rather than one single stroke." -->
![Black Metal](..\assets\img\projects\proj-2\black1.jpg)
4. And the logo is often **unreadable** and purposely made to resemble a **lump of tree roots**. 
![Black Metal](..\assets\img\projects\proj-2\black3.jpg)
5. Though not included in these samples, Black Metal logos also often incorporate (background) **graphics of medieval weapons** (swords, axes, maces, flails, shields). It's most likely done to ground the band in History, with a capital H. It's the Black Metal equivalent of opening a new restaurant in 2021 and hanging up a sign that says, "In business since 1991."

## Pagan Black Metal
Pagan Black Metal is one of many off-shoots of traditional "mainstream" Black Metal; but whereas it can be difficult to differentiate one subgenre of Black Metal from another, it is very easy to recognize a Pagan Black Metal logo. The one thing that sets them apart from all other subgenres is a high level of **"on-the-noseness,"** with **figurative, arty, romantic graphics** accompanying logos that spell out **"pro-Pagan romanticism,"** stopping short of actually spelling out "We put Paganism on a pedestal."
![Pagan Black Metal](..\assets\img\projects\proj-2\pagan.jpg)

# Folk Metal
Closely related to the above is Folk Metal. Where they differ is that while Pagan Black Metal still kinda has the cool factor of Black Metal, Folk Metal has little to no coolness at all, and this shows in the logos. They often take their inspiration from Black Metal aesthetics, with logos made of **lowercase blackletters** or some **Celtic type**, with only **some degree of symmetry** on both opposite ends of the logo, if at all, and even then usually through **decorative curls** rather than through cool letter design.   
![Folk Metal](..\assets\img\projects\proj-2\folk.jpg)

# Crossover Genres
#### Blackened Thrash Metal
Blackened Thrash Metal is what you get when Black Metallers want to play something "thrashy." When this happens, nine out of ten times they commission someone to basically design them a **Death-Doom-like** logo, but one that features **bat wings** and maybe a **pentagram**, too. 
![Blackened Thrash Metal](..\assets\img\projects\proj-2\blackened.jpg)

#### Blackened Death
Blackened Death Metal is usually straight-up Death Metal, but with lyrics that deal with Satanism and the occult. The logos reflect just that: often these are **standard Death** logos, with the only difference being the inclusion of, say, an **inverted cross**.
![Blackened Death Metal](..\assets\img\projects\proj-2\blackened2.jpg)

#### Deathgrind
Deathgrind takes the complexity of Death Metal and fuses it with the intensity, speed, and brevity of grindcore; so therefore it makes sense that Deathgrind logos sit somewhere between Death and Grind logos. More concretely, picture stripped-down, simplistic **Death letters**, overlaid with **splatters and spatters**.  
![Deathgrind](..\assets\img\projects\proj-2\deathgrind2.jpg)

#### Deathgrind (Continued)
* Person A: "Are they a Black Metal band?" 
* Person B: "No, silly. They're a Deathgrind band."

![Deathgrind](..\assets\img\projects\proj-2\deathgrind1.jpg)

If you are anything like Person A, don't feel bad. It's is a very common misconception to mistake a Deathgrind logo for a Black Metal logo. But once you know what to look for and how to interpret it, things becase as clear as day to you. For starters, Black Metal logos are typically black and (inverted) white in color; this one is colored **green**, a color that is often used by Grindcore (and adjacent) bands. Another key thing to look out for are signs of **compositional design** -- or, perhaps rather, **lack thereof**. If a logo features a design of intricate, meticulous linework, it's probably *not* a Deathgrind logo.

# Industrial Metal
As the name suggests, Industrial Metal fuses Heavy Metal and Industrial music, which in itself as fusion of Rock and Electronic music. This is all very interesting, of course; but what it means for anyone interested in metal logos is that in this genre bands' logos typically have a mechanical look to them. When I say "mechanical," I mean that that alone -- **"lifeless, inorganic" letters** (i.e. sharp-edged, blocky, perfectly spaced) that are sometimes (but rarely) tilted 90° degrees to the left from the horizontal.
![Industrial Metal](..\assets\img\projects\proj-2\industrial.jpg)

Though I suppose it could just as well mean that someone downloaded a really cool **sci-fi movie font family** that is in actuality a poor derivative of someone's hard work. 

# Doom Metal
Doom Metal is the last major mode of Heavy Metal music. For those not in the know, unlike the other (sub)genres, Doom doesn't really have any unique genre requirements except for this one thing: it has to be ultra-slow.<sup>4</sup> If it's uptempo, it can't be Doom. But it can anything else. It's as simple as that. Just as simple as that. Anyway, the idea behind this tempo thing is to create a sense of doom or despair. (More like, despairing boredom, amirite?)

This is what makes Doom logo extremely challenging -- challenging for me at least to come up with a genre logo; because it can be so many things depending on a band's specific interests and themes, and they can range anywhere from a dying bride to ... to what exactly? (It's always about some tragic loss of life, isn't it?) To put it flatly, usually it comes down to throwing shit at a wall and hope something sticks. (But this is just me talking ... what do I know? I've only worked with a small number of Doom bands.)


##### [4] William Irwin, *Black Sabbath and Philosophy: Mastering Reality*, p. 79.

## Psychedelic Doom
Nothing says stoner and psychedelia like a **hazy** or **cloud-like** logo. To make it further clear that this music is good for intense couch-sitting and bong-ripping, **greens** and **purples** are often used.
![Psychedelic Doom](..\assets\img\projects\proj-2\psychedelic.jpg)

## Funeral Doom
Funeral Doom is characterized by its sloooooow tempos. The letters are spaced **miles apart** from each other so as to visually convey the sense of mind-numbing slowness. And because the music doesn't inspire anyone to come up a cool custom design, Funeral Doom bands often have to settle for a **wordmark** with maybe some **decorative curls**.   
![Funeral Doom](..\assets\img\projects\proj-2\funeral.jpg)

# Gothic Metal
Gothic Metal is a broadly defined genre, comprising of two main subgenres: on the one hand there's bands that grew out of the Death-Doom genre, favoring gloomy, introspective atmosphere over outward bombast, and on the other hand there's melodic symphonic bands that emerged instead from the more uplifting Power Metal. Below is an example of the former. It probably speaks for itself: The lettering style is inspired by a **Gothic blackletter type**. To add a touch of melancholia, I added some **flowery curls**.
![Gothic-Doom Metal](..\assets\img\projects\proj-2\gothic.jpg)

# Avant-Garde Metal
The term "avant-garde" is often used synomously with "sophisticated." And, certainly, this label holds true for (most) bands playing in this nebulous genre that compromises a range of different (sub)genres. In fact, it comprises of so many heterogenous (sub)genres that "avant-garde" as a genre label has very little meaning aside from, "These guys and gals really know how to play their instruments!"

Funnily enough however, whilst avant-garde bands most likely, definitely, absolutely display technical virtuosity, they tend to have the least inspired, let alone sophisticated, logos. More than often they have **plain wordmarks**. Even more damning is that they seemingly have an inexplicable preference for the **Abaddon type** (or something very close to it). 

![Avant-Garde Metal](..\assets\img\projects\proj-2\avant.jpg)

# Faux Metal
## Nu Metal
What is there to say about Nu logos that has not yet been said by now? They are **puerile in design** and **clumsily drawn**. To its credit in that respect, they convey well what the music is all about.  
![Nu Metal](..\assets\img\projects\proj-2\nu.jpg)

## Metalcore
Metalcore is another one of those "negative synergy" fusion genres that combines the worst elements of extreme metal and hardcore punk. Still it's what all the cool kids -- and only kids -- are listening to these days so I don't know. (Really, don't ask me why. I'm probably getting old.)

Anyway, the design process of a Metalcore logo can best be described as follows: After a band commissions you to do a logo, you do some preliminary sketching, to get a feel of the band's name, and at some point you probably send them out for approval. Now usually these **preliminary sketches** serve both as the scaffolding upon which the definitive lettering is superimposed and as a guide for any additional typographic style information. But with Metalcore logos, you leave the sketches **"as is."** There is no further work done on the logo.
