title: 'Logo Samples'

Here you can see samples of logo designs covering a broad range of metal genres and extreme subgenres with some tongue-in-cheek commentary by Gerrit Rijken. 




# Heavy Metal
GR: I struggled to find a quintessential example of a pure, heavy metal rock logo that I could use as inspiration, because these types of logos are kinda all over the place style-wise, from rough, sketchy logos (Skid Row) to type-only (or type-like) logos (Whitesnake) that have a "Saturday-morning cartoon" feel to them (Winger) -- which I do not mean in a pejorative sense. 

But I'd say generally, as opposed to other the (sub)genres that we discuss in the paper, Heavy Metal logos take their cues from **biker aesthetics** and have a **blocky feel to them**. They're also often **colorful in terms of hues and tinges**.

## NWOBHM
GR: With respect to the New Wave of British Heavy Metal<sup>1</sup>, a rather specific subset of Heavy Metal that emerged, as the name already denotes, in the United Kingdom, the above also applies here. 

Here, I purposely decided to do a logo in the vein of Judas Priest's logo -- well, one of them at least --, because I felt it'd make for an interesting comparison with specifically Teutonic Thrash Metal logos, which can be found further down. The key words here: **industrial**, **tight**, and **laser-like**.

#### Speed Metal
GR: Speed Metal has its roots in NWOBHM and would lay the lay the foundation for later extreme metal genres. As the the name already suggests, it's all about speed. In this it is much like Thrash Metal -- which is probably why Speed logos can easily be mistaken for Thrash logos --, but it's lyrically less abrasive and musically more melodic. So what sets these apart from the rest? I'd say these logos, more than others, convey a visual sense of speed, which is why often the letters are designed in a **cursive style** and **drawn together**, or if not that at least **packed closely together**.

#### Power Metal
GR: Power Metal takes its inspiration from both traditional Heavy Metal and Speed Metal and fuses this with theatrics and bombast in an effort to create something emotionally impactful and powerful. (More often, however, the result is bathos. But that's just me talking.) This may be why Power logos are often **rendered in full 3D**, with a **metallic** or **stony texture**. Because, you know, Power Metal is that deep and powerful!

# Thrash Metal

## Teutonic Thrash Metal 
As a genre, Teutonic Thrash Metal has a distinct German character, and a few notable exceptions aside, this is reflected in the kind of logos bands in this genre have. Like 1980s U.S. Trash logos, Teutonic Thrash logos are **extremely angular, wth fixed angles**, but with way **less emphasis on symmetry**, and the letters are generally **more blocky in shape**.

## Brutal Death Metal


## Death-Doom 
This extreme subgenre was originally inspired by and birthed out of the (crust-)punk scene of the 1980s. It combines the slow tempos and pessimistic, or merely depressive, melodies of Doom Metal with the low, grunting vocals of Death Metal. Typically, a Death-Doom logo is basically a **blackletter(-like) wordmark** (i.e., a type-only logo) surrounded with a **white, sometimes jaggy, halo**.

## Melodic Death Metal
Melodic Death Metal was arguably first pioneered in the United Kingdom, but the genre really came into its own in Sweden, specifically in Gothenburg. As a genre, it took its inspiration from a wide range of styles, from Death Metal to NWOBHM to Progressive Rock, with certain elements from these reference styles more predominant in one band's music than another's, which may help explain why it is difficult to think of a quintessential Melodic Death logo. 

Initially, indeed, in the early 1990s, Melodic Death logos were very diverse in style, with some (seemingly) taking their inspiration from "mainstream" Death Metal logos (In Flames), others had intricate custom designs (At the Gates), while still others opted for a distorted and deformed Celtic type (Dark Tranquility). In later and more recent years, however, most bands in this genre have **highly-readable wordmarks** that are sometimes "touched up" or "filled in" with a **dirt brush**.

## Technical Death Metal
#### 1990s 
A hard-and-fast rule in metal logo design is that the more technical the music, the less sophisticated the logo. This is exemplified in Technical Death Metal, a genre whose artists mix "fast, virtuosic guitar riffs and solos of varying tempos and time signature changes with prevalent drumming and frequent blast beats."<sup>2</sup> It's usually easy to recognize bands playing in this genre. They often have what **looks like a Black Metal logo**, except it's not -- it's **not nearly as sophisticated**. Either that or they have a **type-only logo**, sometimes **superimposed over over an earlier logo** -- usually one of these "Black Metal-like" logos.

#### Post-2000s
It's fairly easy to recognize a post-2000s Technical Death band from a 1990s band in the same genre. For some reason wholly unknown to me, the former is likely to have a logo that they proudly put on their shirts -- even though it doesn't really look good. It's always like these logos were done by a novice who played with **Illustrator** and who is not quite familiar yet with Illustrator's **Pen tool**. The result inevitably is that all these logos have a **"BÃ©zier" look** to them; and this is the reason they *never* look good.

## Progressive Metal
What does "Progressive" mean in the context of Extreme Metal? Who knows? I sure as hell don't. It could mean anything from "We brought in a saxophonist to record a Metal album with us" to a more general "We march to our own beat" -- which is often to be taken literally: Progressive bands seem to have a weird thing for syncopation. The question then is how to best represent this visually? It may seem daunting but it is actually quite easy: (1.) the letters need to be **tight and bold** and (2.) the letters need to be **missing parts**, because this says something about the band's music: "Our music is tight and bold! And it's often difficult to follow and may even end abruptly."

## Pagan Black Metal
Pagan Black Metal is one of many off-shoots of traditional "mainstream" Black Metal; but whereas it can be difficult to differentiate one subgenre of Black Metal from another, it is very easy to recognize a Pagan Black Metal logo. The one thing that sets them apart from all other subgenres is a high level of **"on-the-noseness,"** with **figurative, arty, romantic graphics** accompanying logos that spell out **"pro-Pagan romanticism,"** stopping short of actually spelling out "We put Paganism on a pedestal."
![Pagan Black Metal](..\assets\img\projects\proj-2\pagan.jpg)

## Folk Metal
Closely related to the above is Folk Metal. Where they differ is that while Pagan Black Metal still kinda has the cool factor of Black Metal, Folk Metal has little to no coolness at all, and this shows in the logos. They often take their inspiration from Black Metal aesthetics, with logos made of **lowercase blackletters** or some **Celtic type**, with only **some degree of symmetry** on both opposite ends of the logo, if at all, and even then usually through silly **decorative curls** rather than through cool letter design.

# Crossover
#### Blackened Thrash Metal
Blackened Thrash Metal is what you get when Black Metallers want to play something "thrashy." When this happens, nine out of ten times they commission someone to basically design them a **Death-Doom-like** logo, but one that features **bat wings** and maybe a **pentagram**, too. 
![Blackened Thrash Metal](..\assets\img\projects\proj-2\blackened.jpg)

#### Blackened Death
Blackened Death Metal is usually straight-up Death Metal, but with lyrics that deal with Satanism and the occult. The logos reflect just that: often these are **standard Death** logos, with the only difference being the inclusion of, say, an **inverted cross**.
![Blackened Death Metal](..\assets\img\projects\proj-2\blackened2.jpg)

# Grindcore
Grindcore fuses elements of Heavy Metal with Punk Hardcore, creating a negative synergy where one plus one arguably equals less than two. No wonder, then, that Grindcore logos look **crude and unfinished** at best. But all is not bad either, for great (to some) is the genre's fondness for puerile humor and disgusting aesthetics, with visual **references to scathology and other bodily functions**. In short, think of Grindcore aesthetics as the typographic equivalent of a schoolboy's fantasies. This may also help explain the heavy usage of **color and texture**. (Kids love color. Right? I wouldn't know, I'm not a father.)
![Grindcore](..\assets\img\projects\proj-2\grind.jpg)

#### Deathgrind
* Person A: "Are they a Black Metal band?" 
* Person B: "No, silly. They're a Deathgrind band."

If you are anything like Person A, don't feel bad. It's is a very common misconception to mistake a Deathgrind logo for a Black Metal logo. But once you know what to look for and how to interpret it, things becase as clear as day to you. For starters, Black Metal logos are typically black and (inverted) white in color; this one is colored **green**, a color that is often used by Grindcore (and adjacent) bands. Another key thing to look out for are signs of **compositional design** -- or, perhaps rather, **lack thereof**. If a logo features a design of intricate, meticulous linework, it's probably *not* a Deathgrind logo.

# Industrial Metal

# Doom Metal

## Psychedelic Doom
Nothing says stoner and psychedelia like a **hazy** or **cloud-like logo**. To make it further clear that this music is good for intense couch-sitting and bong-ripping, **greens** and **purples** are often used.
![Psychedelic Doom](..\assets\img\projects\proj-2\psychedelic.jpg)

## Funeral Doom
Funeral Doom is characterized by its sloooooow tempos. The letters are spaced **miles apart** from each other so as to visually convey the sense of mind-numbing slowness. And because the music doesn't inspire anyone to come up a custom design, Funeral Doom bands often have to settle for a **wordmark** with maybe some **decorative curls**.   
![Funeral Doom](..\assets\img\projects\proj-2\funeral.jpg)

# Gothic Metal
Gothic Metal is a broadly defined genre, comprising of two main subgenres: on the one hand there's bands that grew out of the Death-Doom genre, favoring gloomy, introspective atmosphere over outward bombast, and on the other hand there's melodic symphonic bands that emerged instead from the more uplifting Power Metal. Below is an example of the former. It probably speaks for itself: The lettering style is inspired by a **Gothic blackletter type**. To add a touch of melancholia, I added some **flowery curls**.

# Avant-Garde

# Nu Metal
What is there to say about Nu logos that has not yet been said by now? They are **puerile in design** and **clumsily drawn**. To its credit in that respect, they convey well what the music is all about.  
![Nu Metal](..\assets\img\projects\proj-2\nu.jpg)

# Metalcore
The design process of a Metalcore logo can best be described as follows: After a band commissions you to do a logo, you do some preliminary sketching, to get a feel of the band's name, and at some point you probably send them out for approval. Now usually these **preliminary sketches** serve both as the scaffolding upon which the definitive lettering is superimposed and as a guide for any additional typographic style information. But with Metalcore logos, you leave the sketches **"as is."** There is no further work done on the logo.
