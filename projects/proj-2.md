title: 'Logo Samples'
---
Here you can see samples of logo designs covering a broad range of metal genres and extreme subgenres with some tongue-in-cheek commentary by Gerrit Rijken. 




# Heavy Metal
GR: I struggled to find a quintessential example of a pure, heavy metal rock logo that I could use as inspiration, because these types of logos are kinda all over the place style-wise, from rough, sketchy logos (Skid Row) to type-only (or type-like) logos (Whitesnake) that have a "Saturday-morning cartoon" feel to them (Winger) -- which I do not mean in a pejorative sense. 

But I'd say generally, as opposed to other the (sub)genres that we discuss in the paper, Heavy Metal logos take their cues from **biker aesthetics** and have a **blocky feel to them**. They're also often **colorful in terms of hues and tinges**.

## NWOBHM
GR: With respect to the New Wave of British Heavy Metal<sup>1</sup>, a rather specific subset of Heavy Metal that emerged, as the already denotes, in the United Kingdom, the above also applies here. 

Here, I purposely decided to do a logo in the vein of Judas Priest's logo -- well, one of them at least --, because I felt it'd make for an interesting comparison with specifically Teutonic Thrash Metal logos, which can be found further down. The key words here: **industrial**, **tight**, and **laser-like**.

#### Speed Metal
GR: Speed Metal has its roots in NWOBHM and would lay the lay the foundation for later extreme metal genres. As the the name already suggests, it's all about speed. In this it is much like Thrash Metal -- which is probably why Speed logos can easily be mistaken for Thrash logos --, but it's lyrically less abrasive and musically more melodic. So what sets these apart from the rest? I'd say these logos, more than others, convey a visual sense of speed, which is why often the letters are designed in a **cursive style**.

#### Power Metal
GR: Power Metal takes its inspiration from both traditional Heavy Metal and Speed Metal and fuses this with theatrics and bombast in an effort to create something emotionally impactful and powerful. (More often, however, the result is bathos. But that's just me talking.) This may be why Power logos are often **rendered in full 3D**, with a **metallic** or **stony texture**. Because, you know, Power Metal is that deep and powerful!
