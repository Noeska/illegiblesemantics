title: 'Logo Samples'
---
<!-- Here you can see samples of logo designs covering a broad range of metal genres and extreme subgenres with some tongue-in-cheek commentary by Gerrit Rijken. -->

In our paper we explore the "design space" of Metal logos; and when we say "Metal," we refer to Heavy Metal and its Extreme Metal subgenres -- and the subgenres within those. Each of these has its own visual aesthetics and codes that govern how genre logos can or should look like, generally. Here things can get weirdly specific. For example, bands in a genre often have the same kind of logos, but depending on subgenre, bands may have a different kind of logo, and a logo style can even depend on a given band's locality. 

As you can imagine, it can get complicated fairly quickly when you're trying to get a handle on what's what and how things play out visually, concretely, and pratically -- especially if you're not in the know. In order to facilitate understanding, I created 30-something logos, covering a broad range of genres and subgenres of Heavy Metal music. Further down, I added some tongue-in-cheek commentary to give you some insight into the design process of each of these logos.

*Full disclosure: With these genre samples I tried to represent as faithfully as possible a broad range of genres, based on my own years of experience in designing Metal logos and studying up on genres that I'm not too familiar with. I then had them checked by several musicians and artists in the Metal scene to confirm style accuracy and coverage. (The list of names can be found in the paper.) In the days leading up to the submission deadline, I decided to add a few more, in part based on the feedback that I got from them, and in part based on what genres I personally felt were missing. These are: Symphonic Metal, Glam Metal, Bay Area Thrash, Groove Metal, Djent, Porngrind, Pirate Metal, Post-Metal, Sludge Metal. As of yet, these have not been checked and validated by the "field experts." But, ultimately, these remain interpretations, anyway. It may well be that you have other ideas on what these logos are supposed to look like. Maybe you don't think my comments are clever or helpful or funny. In that case, drop me a line on Twitter, and tell me what needs improving.*

# Heavy Metal
Heavy Metal music was birthed by **Black Sabbath** in the late 1960s and early 1970s. From its inception, it was criticized for being "violent, aggressive, dark, depressing, angry, and misogynisitc."<sup>1</sup> Little did people know then that things were to get only more and more extreme. But it would take about two decades before Heavy Metal started to branch out in the evermore extreme subgenres of Thrash, Death, Doom, and Black Metal (these will be discussed below), because that's how long it took for Heavy Metal to enter the mainstream of music. Of course, once that happened, many felt that Heavy Metal had become too commercial and too popular. Indeed, by the mid- to late-1980s, Heavy Metal had lost much of its original bark; now it was time to make things insular again.


<!-- 
Just like Heavy Metal (along with other alternative music genres) originally came into being as a reaction against the "good vibrations" of the 1960s, the glam and glitter of the early 1970s music industry, and the toothlessness of the 1960s anti-establishment rockers who by the end of the era had become establishment figures themselves, the emergence of Extreme Metal was a reaction against 1980s Heavy Metal that many felt had become too commercial and too popular.<sup>2</sup>  By then, it had lost its authenticity -- and worse yet, its bite. 

The reason it took about two decades before Heavy Metal started to branch in evermore extreme subgenres (Thrash, Death, Doom, Black) is because it took that long for Heavy Metal to enter the mainstream of music. 

By the mid-1980s, many felt Heavy Metal had become too commercial and too popular. Indeed, it had lost much of its original bite. 
-->




What this means for our purposes is that we're looking at two decades of design evolution. Which is why I struggled to find a quintessential example of a pure, Heavy Metal Rock logo that I could use as inspiration, because these types of logos are kinda all over the place style-wise, from (initial) **wordmark** (i.e. type-only) logos of 1970s Heavy Metal bands (**Black Sabbath**, **Judas Priest**, **Motörhead**, **Scorpions**) to the extremely diverse custom logos of 1980s Heavy Metal bands. The latter range from rough, sketchy logos (**Skid Row**) to airbrushed or painted designs (**Y&T**) to logos that have "Saturday-morning cartoon" feel to them (**Danger Danger**).


<!-- 
blues-based bands
1960s
electrified blues
rolling stones, yardbirds, cream

good vibrations of the 1960s
stones ... dinosaurs, old farts, establishment figures

rejecting the glitter of early 1970s
wanted a more grittier, more authentic form of rock music
rejection of big-time bands and the emergence of alternative musics

-- which I do not mean in a pejorative sense
-->


But I'd say generally, as opposed to other the (sub)genres that we discuss in the paper, Heavy Metal logos take their cues from **biker** and ersatz **Nazi aesthetics** with sometimes **Runic motifs** and stereotypically have a **blocky feel to them**. They're also often **colorful in terms of hues and tinges**.

<a name="NWOBHM"></a> 
## NWOBHM
In the late-1970s and early-1980s, as the British Heavy Metal supergroups (**Black Sabbath**, **Deep Purple**, **Judas Priest**) that once were part of the anti-establishment, had now became part of the Establishment, a new wave of British Heavy Metal (NWOBHM) emerged all over Britain. As a genre, NWOBHM encompasses diverse mainstream and underground styles, but one thing that bands playing in this genre shared in common is that they drew inspiration from the anti-establishment punk movement of the late-1970s, producing fast and raw songs.

With respect to NWOBHM logos, what was said earlier about Heavy Metal logos also applies here -- style-wise they're all over the place.

Here, I purposely decided to do a logo in the vein of those of **Iron Maiden** and **Judas Priest**, because I felt it'd make for an interesting comparison with specifically Teutonic (i.e. German) Thrash Metal logos, which can be found further down. The key words here: **industrial**, **tight**, and **laser-like**.

<a name="speed"></a> 
#### Speed Metal
Speed Metal has its roots in NWOBHM and would lay the foundation for later extreme metal genres. As the the name already suggests, it's all about *speed*. In this it's much like Thrash Metal -- which is probably why Speed logos can easily be mistaken for Thrash logos --, but it's lyrically less abrasive and musically more melodic. So what sets Speed logos apart from the rest? I'd say these, more than others, convey a **visual sense of speed**, which is why often the letters are designed in a **cursive style** and **drawn together in a single line**, or if not that at least **packed closely together**.

<a name="power"></a> 
#### Power Metal
Power Metal takes its inspiration from both "traditional" Heavy Metal and Speed Metal and fuses the elements therefrom with theatrics and bombast in an effort to create something emotionally impactful and powerful. (More often, however, the result is akin to Wagnerian *bathos*, which is no doubt the reason why Power Metal is only really popular in Germany and German-speaking Europe.) This may be why Power logos are often **rendered in full 3D**, with a **metallic** or **stony texture**. Because, you know, Power Metal is that deep and powerful! Like metal or stone!

<a name="symphonic"></a> 
#### Symphonic Metal
One subgenre that I originally couldn't be bothered with -- even though it is a major one -- is Symphonic Metal. This is an off-shoot genre of Power Metal, and thus shares much of its musical DNA with its parent genre. This linkage is also visible in the band names. These are often lifted from Power Metal songs. If a Symphonic Metal band is called Dragon-Fiddler, then it's likely a Power Metal band once put out a track called something along the lines of "Dewi's Mystical Hymne (The Scarlet Dragon-Fiddler)." 

Where Symphonic Metal bands differ from Power Metal bands is that the former put even more emphasis on the bombast, believing themselves to be following in the footsteps of scoring giants like John Williams or Hans Zimmer -- though they'd be lucky if they could do the score for a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7M0_9YcRDQ0" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span>Uwe Boll</span></a> movie --, and they're more likely to be female-fronted; and if they aren't, then it still sounds like they are. 

It's generally easy to recognize Symphonic Metal bands from others. Nine out of ten bands have a **serif wordmark** with a **textured gradient fill** for a logo, with maybe one or two **customly elongated tails** -- making it look like someone sneezed while working on the letters; the tenth band, meanwhile, probably has a regular Power Metal logo. <!-- Oh, and if they play speedy music, the letters are probably in **cursive**. -->

<a name="glam"></a> 
## Glam Metal (a.k.a. Hair Metal)
In the late-1980s, when Heavy Metal was as mainstream as anything else on MTV (does anyone remember MTV?), the Heavy Metal movement began taking after the 1970s, specifically 1970s Glam Rock (**T. Rex**, **David Bowie**, **Alice Cooper**, **Queen**). Popular Heavy Metal artists started teasing their hair and applying girly make-up, in an effort to look as androgynous as possible, and putting an emphasis on stagecraft over substance and authenticity. Today, no one would bat an eye, but these were the 1980s, after all, and many Metal fans were like, "This is getting way too poppy and wimpy," and we should all be grateful for that. If it wasn't for them -- fans and artists alike -- who knows if, say, the Black Metal scene would have emerged as it did -- with artists donning makeup and taking after the gay leather scene?<sup>4</sup>

# Thrash Metal
Abrasive. Loud. Extremely fast yet still precise, with impeccable sense of timing. If judging by these words alone, it may sound like I'm describing a Dutch olympian -- a speed skater or a cyclist, perhaps. But we're talking music, aren't we? I'm talking Thrash Metal, of course, which means I'm talking yet another extreme subgenre of Heavy Metal. 

As a scene, it emerged simultaneously in different parts of the world, in different countries (Britain, Germany, Latin America, and the US), from where it developed out of different genres (most notably NWOBHM and Punk Hardcore). This is why there is a variety of styles within the Thrash genre -- one that is in large part determined by bands' locality. 

Of course, Thrash Metal has its own aesthetics, too. Generally speaking, Thrash logos tend to have **straight, sharp edges** which reflect the tightness and controlled nature of the music's rhythms.<sup>5</sup> (You know, tight and controlled ... like a murderer carving their name in a victim's chest.<sup>6</sup>) Indeed, some exceptions aside, there is no softness to be found in them whatsoever -- there is only hardness.

## US Thrash
<!--In the U.S., Thrash Metal emerged against the backdrop of Reagan conservatism and the concurrent emergence and rise in popularity of the more mainstream friendly Glam Metal genre. This context proved extremely fertile ground for a new kind of sound, and for some reason especially in California, especially in the San Francisco Bay Area. 

It is important to stress here that this is not a hard-and-fast rule for U.S. Thrash aesthetics. Ed Repka, an American graphic artist, for example, has been an instrumental figure in definining said aesthetics. 

And what's really interesting here is that the aesthetics of the Bay Area scene was characterized by a "do-it-yourself" ethos, as opposed to the Metal bands of yore who often used already established fonts.<sup>2</sup> 

##### Billboard, 14. apr. 2004, p. 24
For logos, many bands within the Bay Area scene had a more "do it yourself"-artistic approach[32] compared to the older metal bands using an already established font.

The logo below was based on Dark Angel's logo. Though technically not a band from the Bay Area -- though still from California -- , I feel their logo captures best the look of the U.S. Thrash genre. -->

It can be difficult to differentiate between a US Thrash band and a German one; perhaps the only clue is that US Thrash logos are more likely to have hints or elements of **symmetry** (because Americans love symmetry in all things except the balance of power) and **interconnectedness** to them. Come to think of it, they may also have more likelihood of having an **outline** or **"halo"** surrounding the the letters.

<a name="bay"></a> 
#### Bay Area Thrash
If we are to distinguish further among US Thrash Metal bands and we continue differentiating, then the early-1980s San Francisco Bay Area scene surely deserves some attention from everyone! What's interesting here is that the aesthetics of said scene were largely characterized by a "do-it-yourself" ethos, as opposed to the aesthetics of the then already established Metal bands who often used established fonts for their logos (see **Iron Maiden**, for example). Arguably the most famous example of this is **Metallica**'s logo which was drawn up by none other than James Hetfield himself. This may be why certain US Thrash logos, or part of these logos, **look a bit off**; because they were not always done by trained graphical designers who are familiar with rulers and with drawing and measuring segments.

Another thing to point out here is that in Bay Area Thrash logos you can often find a **juxtaposition of straight lines with round shapes** or **straight lines against curved lines**. To refer back to the example of Metallica's logo, the C is rounded, but the first and last letters are sharp and italicized.

## Teutonic Thrash 
As a genre, Teutonic Thrash Metal has a distinct German character, and a few notable exceptions aside, this is reflected in the kind of logos bands in this genre have. Like 1980s US Thrash logos, Teutonic Thrash logos are **extremely angular, with fixed angles**, but with **less emphasis on symmetry**, and the letters are generally **more blocky in shape**. With this, German Thrashers seem to be saying, "We believe in robustness over sophistication, and function over form." Which is all fine and dandy until you try to put a cube through a round hole. It's probably why you've never heard of **Kreator** ... while you no doubt own a copy of the **"Black"** album.

<a name="groove"></a> 
#### Groove Metal
Groove Metal is an off-shoot of Thrash. The riffs are thrashy, but the tempos are slower -- down from 200 to a more danceable 135 beats-per-minutes on average. Because Groove Metal is a softened-up version of Thrash, it's only obvious that bands in this genre have a "softer" logo. And what is softer than a metal? Exacly -- wood. So I gave this one a **wooden finish**. (Honestly, I had no idea what I was supposed to do with Groove Metal. So I took some cues from Pantera and White Zombie and this is what it resulted in.)

# Death Metal
Death Metal at large is one of the major "mainstream" modes of Extreme Metal. It's typically characterized by low-tuned, heavily distorted guitars, aggressive, thumping drumming (featuring double-kicks and blast-beats), deep growling vocals, abrupt and complex changes in tempo and time signature ... As a genre, it is very broad, encompassing a great deal of diversity. Indeed, it has spawned several subgenres since its inception in the mid- to late-1980s, all with their own specific iconography. Here I will be covering only some of them. 

As a general rule it can be observed that in this genre the letters making up the logos tend to be **thick** and **bold** as opposed to, say, the letters making up Black Metal logos. The latter tend to be thin and sometimes somewhat shaky. (In that these logos strikingly resemble the fans of these respective genres who are generally respectively heavy set characters and lanky, out-of-sorts pushovers.) 

And, contrary to Thrash Metal logos, Death Metal logos tend to have more **"soft" elements**. This, too, makes perfect sense. Thrash gives its fans a linear, myopic view on life in general: it's all about alienation and oppression from a threatening, hostile world of authority -- yet it offers nothing helpful in way of unburdering; meanwhile, ironically, Death offers a more rounded approach to life -- offering a safe, routinized way of exploring things that would terrify or disgust most, which enables a cathartic dissipation of everyday's tension.<sup>7</sup> (I'm not gonna lie -- I really didn't expect to find a source to kinda back this up.)

<a name="brutal"></a> 
## Brutal Death
Brutal Death Metal emerged most notably from the 1980s New York Hardcore movement. It's characterized by its thumping heaviness, high-speed power chording and riffing, and overall complex rhythms. As a rule, their lyrics deal with slasher movies and True Crime, and this is often reflected in their choice of logos. These typically incorporate **gore elements** (e.g., bones, intestines, and blood), sometimes to the point where the entire logo exactly resembles like a jigsaw puzzle of bones dripping blood.

<a name="florida"></a> 
#### Florida Death Metal
When it comes to Death Metal, the Florida Death Metal scene deserves some special attention. Here the bands that emerged in the late-1980s were not so much inspired by the Hardcore movement but rather built on the musical formula established by early-1980s Thrash Metal and the first wave of Black Metal bands. These Florida bands were also lyrically more inspired, expressly refined, dealing with more abstract concepts such as religion, enlightenment, and ecology. 

In terms of logo design, it's hard to pinpoint specific characteristics. Perhaps significantly, perhaps coincidentally, I'd say, on the whole, these logos tend to have a "tattoo-like," "hellfirish" quality to them (think here of **tribal flames** with their scythe-like edges or 1950s-style **hotrod flames**).

<a name="melodic"></a> 
## Melodic Death Metal
Melodic Death Metal was arguably first pioneered in the United Kingdom, but the genre really came into its own in Sweden, specifically in Gothenburg. As a genre, it took its inspiration from a wide range of styles, from Death Metal to NWOBHM to Progressive Rock, with certain elements from these reference styles more predominant in one band's music than another's, which may help explain why it's difficult to think of a quintessential Melodic Death logo. 

Initially, indeed, in the early 1990s, Melodic Death logos were very diverse in style, with some (seemingly) taking their inspiration from "mainstream" Death Metal logos (**In Flames**), others had intricate custom designs (**At the Gates**), while still others opted for a distorted and deformed Celtic type (**Dark Tranquillity**). In later and more recent years, however, most bands in this genre have **highly-readable wordmarks** that are sometimes "touched up" or "filled in" with a **dirt brush**. 

Looking at the history of some of these bands, it kinda makes perfect sense. Take **In Flames**, for example. In the early-1990s, they were amongst the first to pioneer Melodic Death Metal, releasing their first two albums with a fiery red Death Metal-inspired logo with a keyline detail. Then, in the late 1990s, they changed their style towards a more general melodic sound, which had them change their logo to a (seemingly) unmodified, cursive wordmark. A few years later, they dipped their toes in the Metalcore craze of the mid-2000s, releasing some albums with a non-cursive wordmark. And, more recently, they seem to have settled down for an "alternative" sound, which had them change logos yet again ... If a band changes styles more often than I change my underwear, it makes no sense to commit to an ephemeral genre logo; hence probably the choice for a basic logo.

**In Flames** are not an isolated example; **Amorphis**, **At the Gates**, **Carcass**, **Dark Tranquillity**, **Hypocrisy** -- basically all the major bands in this genre have "gone basic" at some point in their career -- some permanently, some only momentarily.

<a name="tech"></a> 
## Technical Death Metal
A hard-and-fast rule in Death Metal aesthetics is that the more technical the music, the less sophisticated the logo. This is exemplified in Technical Death Metal, a genre whose musicians and artists mix "fast, virtuosic guitar riffs and solos of varying tempos and time signature changes with prevalent drumming and frequent blast beats."<sup>8</sup> It's like they opt to convey an impression of modesty (or perhaps false modesty), often leading to conversations like this:

- "I can play with my eyes closed!"
- "Cool! But did you also have to do that logo with your eyes closed?"

It is worthhile pointing out here that you can often place a band in this genre somewhere in time just by looking at the band's logo. In the 1990s and before, Tech Death bands had "analogously" hand-drawn logos; post-2000s, these logos have been done mostly digitally -- and it shows.

Logo-wise, it's usually easy to recognize 1990s bands playing in this genre. They often have what **looks like a Black Metal logo**, except it's not -- it's **not nearly as sophisticated**.
![Technical Death Metal](..\assets\img\projects\proj-2\tech90.jpg)
If they're still active to this day, they now probably have a **type-only logo**, one that is most likely **superimposed** over an earlier "Black Metal-like" logo.

#### Post-2000s Tech Death
It's fairly easy to recognize a post-2000s Technical Death band from a 1990s band in the same genre. For some reason wholly unknown to me, the former is likely to have a logo that they proudly put on their shirts -- even though it doesn't really look good. It's always like these logos were done by a novice who played with **Illustrator** and who is not quite familiar yet with Illustrator's **Pen tool**. The result inevitably is that all these logos have a **"Bézier" look** to them; and this is the reason they *never* look good.

<a name="progressive"></a> 
## Progressive Metal
What does "Progressive" mean in the context of Metal? Who knows? I sure as hell don't. It could mean anything from "We brought in a saxophonist to record a Metal album with us" to a more general "We march to our own beat" -- which is often to be taken literally: Progressive bands seem to have a weird thing for *syncopation*. 

The question then is how to best represent this visually? It may seem daunting but it is actually quite easy: (1) the letters need to be **tight and bold** and (2) the letters need to be **missing parts**, because this says something about the band's music: "Our music is tight and bold! And it's often difficult to follow and may even end abruptly."

<a name="djent"></a> 
#### Djent
Djent. I know it's a spin-off from Progressive Metal; but what is it, really? Literally no one knows. But you know what it is when you hear it. (*The drumming starts off slow, then accelerates in bursts.* Padummm dum dum doom! padummm dum dum doom! *Shortly after, the singer's whiny vocals kick in ...*) And unless you're a Metal Hipster, you probably won't like it. Indeed, it is one of two genres that attracts a high proportion of Hipsters. You probably never heard of the other one. You haven't -- they're so underground, they're not even "indie."


<!-- And unless you spent *both* your work and your free time behind a computer screen, you probably won't like it. Indeed, it is one of two genres that attracts a high proportion of researchers and students in computer science -- the other being Tolkien-themed Power Metal. -->

Djent logos are often deluged with "coffee stains." This is not necessarily a conscious design choice. It's simply because a lotta accidents happen when you spend your time writing songs in an independent urban coffee bar.

# Grindcore
Grindcore is one of the heavier microgenres. It fuses elements of Thrash and Death as well as Crust and Hardcore, and does away with things like standard time signatures, creating a negative synergy where one plus one usually equals less than two. No wonder, then, that Grindcore logos look **crude and unfinished** at best. But all is not bad either, for great (to some) is the genre's fondness for puerile humor and disgusting aesthetics, with **visual references to scathology** and **other bodily functions**. In short, think of Grindcore aesthetics as the typographic equivalent of a schoolboy's fantasies. This may also help explain the heavy usage of **color** and **texture**. (Kids love color. Right? I wouldn't know, I'm not a father.)

## Porngrind
**TMI WARNING!!!** 

This warning may be a bit late in the guide, but you should use caution in allowing your youngsters or colleagues to see you reading this.

Some people suggested I should add some distinct subgenres of Grindcore. There are quite a few, such as Goregrind (**Cliteater**, **Haemorrhage**, **General Surgery**) and Cybergrind (**Cutting Pink with Knives**, **Genghis Tron**, **iamerror**), but here I'll focus only on Porngrind, a microgenre that is fixated on, as you may have already surmised, pornographic lyrical themes. 

Understand that the reason I picked this one out is only because I've already had the dubious honor of doing on a Porngrind logo before (don't ask), so I was able to use it as a base to draw upon. I think the logo speaks for itself so that I need not elaborate on it.

*Due to the graphic NSFW nature of the sample logo, we thought it best to **not** display the sample logo in full-frame view, but for those interested, you can see it* <a href="..\assets\img\projects\proj-2\porngrind.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span>*here*</span></a>.

It's a genre so base and vile, you won't be able to find most bands on Spotify. Luckily, there's still Youtube ...

# Black Metal
Black Metal is one of the more extreme subgenres of Heavy Metal music, not just in terms of music but equally in terms of commitment and attitude. Very early since its inception, artists and fans alike have taken things to extremes, committing acts of self-maiming, suicide, arson, grave-robbing, and in some cases even murder; though these days it's really just another music genre that's out there. 

While there are many subgenres of Black Metal, they all, or most of them, share common traits. These include fast tempos, shrieking vocals, heavily distorted guitars, lo-fi recording (which is really a nice way of saying, "poor production values"), and a preference of atmosphere over technique. 

Lyrically and thematically, songs often deal with the occult, Satanism, and diabolic perversion. Sometimes, it's about following the "left-hand path" rather than the "right-hand way;" sometimes it's just plain raging against religion, or at least Christianity. Other times, it's about exploring Nietzsche's Zarathustra; still other times, it's about black crows on a tombstone.  

In the mid-1980s, and especially in the early 1990s, there were created a few logos that proved seminal in the years to come, most notably the logos of **Mayhem** and **Emperor**. Basically, every Black Metal logo created now takes its cues from both of these. Also, the guy who did the Emperor logo went on to do 10,000(!) logos -- mostly in the Black (and Death) Metal scene.<sup>9</sup> Which is why, regardless of subgenre (Ambient Black Metal, Depressive Suicidal Black Metal, Raw Black Metal, Psychedelic Black Metal, Symphonic Black Metal, War Metal), Black Metal logos tend to look alike. Indeed, they all share a couple of logo and letter design traits: 

1. The logos often display a **high degree of symmetry**; 
![Black Metal](..\assets\img\projects\proj-2\black2.jpg)
2. Black Metal logos also often incorporate (background) **graphics of medieval weapons** (swords, axes, maces, flails, shields). It's most likely done to ground the band in History, with a capital H. It's the Black Metal equivalent of opening a new restaurant in 2021 and hanging up a sign that says, "In business since 1991."
![Black Metal](..\assets\img\projects\proj-2\blackshield.jpg)
3. The logos often feature either **abstract Satanic, occult, or anti-Christian imagery** (inverted crosses, pentagrams, demon and magick sigils) or **figurative graphics pertaining to the dark arts** (candles, wolf heads, goat heads, dragons, daggers, crescents moons) or sometimes both;
![Black Metal](..\assets\img\projects\proj-2\black4.jpg)
4. The letters are often in **blackletter(-like) form**, either in lowercase or uppercase, with **flourishes (curls and spikes)** and **exaggerated edges**; <!-- Flourishes and exaggerated are commonplace, "with extaneous strokes running parallel, rather than one single stroke." -->
![Black Metal](..\assets\img\projects\proj-2\black1.jpg)
5. And the logo is often **unreadable** and purposely made to resemble a **lump of tree roots**. To fans of the genre, it signals, "Good luck seeing the forest to the trees." To anyone else, "Good luck finding something -- *anything* -- interesting in this musical mess."
![Black Metal](..\assets\img\projects\proj-2\black3.jpg)

The Black Metal scene, as we commonly know it today, emerged in Norway in the late-1980s and early-1990s. But the Norwegian bands that made up the scene were actually part of the second wave of Black Metal.

<!-- Post-Black Metal -->
<!-- US BM, NSBM, Depressive Suicidal BM, Industrial BM, ambient BM, War Metal -->
<!-- is there any noticeable difference? or is it all Szpajdel? --> 



Today, Black Metal is an international phenomemon, and there are many Black Metal doing things differently than the way the bands of the first and second wave did and sometimes still do, both in terms of music and of the ethos of making Black Metal, so it's impossible to cover them all here. But the bands mentioned above, should help get you some idea of how these bands vary in style and intensity.

<a name="pagan"></a> 
## Pagan Black
Pagan Black Metal is one of many off-shoots of traditional "mainstream" Black Metal; but whereas it can be difficult to differentiate one subgenre of Black Metal from another, it is very easy to recognize a Pagan Black Metal logo. The one thing that sets them apart from all other subgenres is a high level of **"on-the-noseness,"** with **figurative, arty, romantic graphics** accompanying logos that spell out **"pro-Pagan romanticism,"** stopping short of actually spelling out "We put Paganism on a pedestal."

## Post-Black

Today we see bands that have moved beyond what "traditional" Black Metal is all about. These fall in the genre of Post-Black Metal. (Post-Metal as a genre at large will be discussed later.)

Typically, Post-Black Metal logos take the form of Gothic hand-writing. It's like someone looked at the <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0162661/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span>Sleepy Hollow logo</span></a> and said, "That right there is what I want."

# Folk Metal
Closely related to the above is Folk Metal. Where they differ is that while Pagan Black Metal still kinda has the cool factor of Black Metal, Folk Metal has little to no coolness at all, and this shows in the logos. They often take their inspiration from Black Metal aesthetics, with logos made of **lowercase blackletters** or some **Celtic type**, with only **some degree of symmetry** on both opposite ends of the logo, if at all, and even then usually through **decorative curls** rather than through cool letter design.   
![Folk Metal](..\assets\img\projects\proj-2\folk.jpg)

## Folk Metal (Continued)
Some Folk bands take things to the next level by incorporating **viking helmets** and **drinking-horns** in their logos to signal to people, "When you come to our show, you're free to live out your viking fantasy vicariously. By all means, bring your plastic drinking-horn!" And why wouldn't you, if you're a fan of Folk Metal. You've already ostracized yourself from typical metalheads anyway, you may as well commit to the LARP thing.

#### Pirate Metal
Just when the world of Metal was like no more, everyone found out that rock bottom has a basement. While some were content with pretending to be Vikings, drinking from plastic drinking-horns while wearing tartan kilts, others got to thinking one day -- why stop there? The next logical step was of course to do -- you may have already guessed it -- the pirate thing. 

As you would expect, it's easy to do a Pirate Metal logo. Just do a **skull and a crossbones** logo, and you're golden. You may also think of adding a **falchion** or any other **curved sword** to really drive home that you're doing the whole pirate thing.

<a name="crossover"></a> 
# Crossover Genres
When it comes to crossover genres, certain genres, or elements of them, are more likely to "crossover" than others. As it with fashion, so it is with Extreme Metal: Black goes with everything. Indeed, you can find bands that play Blackened Death (**Angelcorpse**, **Akercocke**, **Belphegor**), Blackened Death-Doom (**Bölzer**, **Necros Christos**, **Soulburn**), Blackened Speed (**Bulldozer,** **Exorcist**, **Sodomizer**), Blackened Thrash (**Aura Noir**, **Deströyer 666**, **Witchery**), Blackened Grindcore (**Absvrdist**, **Sunlight's Bane**, **Vomit Fist**), Blackened Noise (**Gnaw Your Tongue**, **Enbilulugugal**, **Sutekh Hexen**), Blackened Sludge (**Inter Arma**, **Lord Mantis**, **Tombs**), the list goes on.  


This may need some explanation. Early in the 1990s, Black Metal was often used synonomously with "Satanic Metal" by fans and artists alike because to many of them it really was all about devil worship.<sup>10</sup> Furthermore, a string of church arsons in Norway and incidents of grave robbery throughout Europe -- even in the heart of Heerlen, a small city in the south of the Netherlands --, were not unknown after the emergence of the scene, and all contributed to the cementing of the label and stereotype of "Satanic Metal" in the public conscience.

But of course, no genre holds or can hold a monopoly on the practice of Satanism or any religion. And indeed, plenty of musicians and artists outside of the Black Metal scene are (and have been) sort of interested and entrenched in these things. But the label has stuck, and so now we use "Blackened" as an "adjective-predicate," or a shorthand, for specific non-Black Metal bands and genres that deal on some level with the occult. 




<!-- The one outlier that I can think of is Heavy Metal; I'm not sure if there's a thing such as Blackened Heavy Metal. 

Maybe there is actually. 

Though it was the Norwegian "scene" and Norwegian bands that put the genre on the map, it was actually born out of the early-1980s NWOBHM scene discussed earlier.<sup>4</sup> You see, the term "Black Metal" was first coined by the NWOBHM band **Venom** with the release of their second LP, *Black Metal*. 

As per Conrad Lant, a.k.a. Cronos, the driving force behind **Venom**:

> "Coming up with a term like black metal or thrash metal, it was great when bands came along and used those titles. The Norwegians used the term black metal ten years later 'cos they knew they would automatically be put into a category they wanted to be in. They were like, 'This is dirty, this is nasty, this is Satanic, we're gonna put fucking corpsepaint on, sing about Satan'... they knew the black metal tag would give them an identity."

This quote says it all. Early in the 1990s, Black Metal was often used synonomously with "Satanic Metal" by fans and artists alike.
> "*All* black metal is religious in my eyes", Morgan [**Marduk**] states. "All these different types of black etal ... to me it's black metal or it's not black metal. People ask me, 'Ar you black metal?' Yes we are. We are one of probably five bands who *are* black metal, 'cos no on wants to be black metal, they want to be 'neo-this' and 'experimental-that', but we are proud to carry the banner of black metal."<sup>5</sup>

> "That's what black metal is," concurs Mortuus [**Marduk**]. "If it's not about devil worship or destructive Satanism, I couldn't call it black metal. It's not like black metal *has* to be Satanic -- if it's not Satanic, it's not black metal, it's 'something else-metal' -- there's a million labels, choose one of them. Black metal is Satanic metal. I really don't like to label myself, but if there *would* be a label for it, it would be devil worship. That's what it is, even if I don't like the term."

But of course, no genre holds a monopoly on Satanism and the occult in general. And indeed, plenty of musicians and artists outside of the Black Metal scene are (and have been) sort of interested and entrenched in these things. So now we use "Blackened" as an adjective-predicate to identify specific non-Black Metal bands and genres (in terms of music) that deal on some level with the occult. 

##### [4] Daniele Federico Rosa, 'Ye Go to Thy Abzu: How Norwegian Black Metal Used Mesopotamian References, Where It Took Them From, and How It Usually Got Them Wrong', Lorenzo Verderame and Agnès Garcia-Ventura, *Receptions of the Ancient Near East in Popular Culture and Beyond*, 106, and Dayal Patterson, *Black Metal: Evolution of the Cult*, 2009 (Chapter 22 on Burzum)
##### [5] Dayal Patterson, *Black Metal: Evolution of the Cult*, (Chapter on Marduk)

substantive constructed as a limiting genitive

That doesn't quite work with other genres. There is no such thing as "Deathened" to denote any bands outside of the Death scene that thematically deal with, say, True Crime. Which is not to say there are no Death Metal-influenced crossover genres.**
-->



This doesn't quite work with other genres. The term "Deathened" isn't a generally accepted term. Which is not to say there are no Death Metal-influenced crossover genres; it's just that in these cases, "Death" is used as an adjective or as a limiting genitive. There's Death-Doom, for example, which can be considered as practically a genre in itself and which will be discussed below. 

Another example would be Deathrash (**Legion of the Damned**, **The Crown**, **Mortification**). Here I'd say the crossover has more to do with music than the lyrical themes. What's more, one could even go so far as to claim that in this specific case, it's not so much a crossover from one genre to another but just a normal result of "genre-adjacency." After all, Death Metal didn't emerge in isolation, but developed in part out of Thrash in the mid-1980s, and so naturally some bands will fall somewhere on the spectrum between the two. Which is probably why you won't ever hear anyone use the term "Deathtrash."

Lastly, there's Death 'n' Roll (**The Cumshots**, **Entombed A.D.**, **Helltrain**), which combines Death Metal's trademark vocals and distorted and down-tuned guitars with elements of 1970s Hard Rock.

<a name="bthrash"></a> 
## Blackened Thrash
Blackened Thrash Metal is what you get when Black Metallers want to play something "thrashy" (i.e. getting drunk on beer and **Motörhead**). When this happens, nine out of ten times they commission someone to basically design them a **Death-Doom-like** logo, but one that features **bat wings** and maybe a **pentagram**, too.

<a name="bdeath"></a> 
## Blackened Death
Blackened Death Metal is usually straight-up Death Metal, but with lyrics that deal with Satanism and the occult. The logos reflect just that: often these are **run-of-the-mill Death** logos, with the only difference being the inclusion of, say, an **inverted cross** or **devil horns**.

<a name="deathdoom"></a> 
## Death-Doom 
This extreme subgenre was originally inspired by and birthed out of the (crust-)punk scene of the 1980s, most notably but not exclusively in Stockholm, Sweden. It combines the slow tempos and pessimistic, or merely depressive, melodies of Doom Metal with the low, grunting vocals of Death Metal.

Typically, a Death-Doom logo is a **blackletter(-like) wordmark** surrounded with a **white, sometimes jaggy, halo**, and this undoubtedly because it just screams, "What are we but mere characters in a negative space."

<a name="deathgrind"></a> 
## Deathgrind
Deathgrind takes the complexity of Death Metal and fuses it with the intensity, speed, and brevity of grindcore; so therefore it makes sense that Deathgrind logos sit somewhere between Death and Grind logos. More concretely, picture stripped-down, simplistic **Death letters** that are overlaid with **splatters and spatters**.  
![Deathgrind](..\assets\img\projects\proj-2\deathgrind2.jpg)

#### Deathgrind (Continued)
* Person A: "Are they a Black Metal band?" 
* Person B: "No, silly. They're a Deathgrind band."

![Deathgrind](..\assets\img\projects\proj-2\deathgrind1.jpg)

If you are anything like Person A, don't feel bad. It's is a very common misconception to mistake a Deathgrind logo for a Black Metal logo. But once you know what to look for and how to interpret it, things becase as clear as day to you. 

For starters, Black Metal logos are typically black and (inverted) white in color; this one is colored **green**, a color that is often used by Grindcore (and adjacent) bands. (After all, Grindcore is all about doing things differently, and nothing quite says different like green, which, in terms of pigments, is the opposite of red, the choice color of many bands in the Heavy Metal genre at large.) Another key thing to look out for are signs of **compositional design** -- or, perhaps rather, **lack thereof**. If a logo features a design of intricate, meticulous linework, it's probably *not* a Deathgrind logo.

<a name="industrial"></a> 
# Industrial Metal
As the name suggests, Industrial Metal fuses Heavy Metal and Industrial music, which in itself as fusion of Rock and Electronic music. This is all very interesting, of course; but what it means for anyone interested in metal logos is that in this genre bands' logos typically have a mechanical look to them. When I say "mechanical," I mean that alone -- **"lifeless, inorganic" letters** (i.e. sharp-edged, blocky, perfectly spaced) that are sometimes tilted 90° degrees to the left from the horizontal. Furthermore, these logos are often **lettermarks** featuring only bands' initials -- usually in a unique typesetting. But this is difficult to illustrate with a name like **VIS**.

<!--
Not to be a gatekeeper, but I think it makes sense that these logos look "unmetal" because the genre is so far removed from "traditional" Heavy Metal. To me it's like having you, if you're an American, tell me, "I'm part Dutch -- my great-great-great-great-great-grandfather originally came from the Netherlands before he settled in Kinderhook, sometime after the American Revolution." Cool! But that doesn't make you Dutch. So ... maybe you should stop putting emphasis on it.

<a name="doom"></a> 
# Doom Metal
Doom Metal is the last major mode of Heavy Metal music. For those not in the know, unlike the other (sub)genres, Doom doesn't really have any unique genre requirements except for this one thing: it has to be ultra-slow.<sup>11</sup> If it's uptempo, it can't be Doom. But it can be anything else. It's as simple as that. Just as simple as that. Anyway, the idea behind this tempo thing is to create a sense of doom or despair. (More like, despairing boredom, amirite?)

This is what makes Doom logo extremely challenging -- challenging for me at least to come up with a genre logo; because it can be so many things depending on a band's specific interests and themes, and they can range anywhere from a dying bride to ... to what exactly? (It's always about some tragic loss of life, isn't it?) To put it flatly, usually it comes down to throwing shit at a wall and hope something sticks. (But this is just me talking ... what do I know? I've only worked with a small number of Doom bands.)

<a name="funeral"></a> 
## Funeral Doom
Funeral Doom is characterized by its sloooooow tempos -- slow even for Doom standards. The letters are spaced **miles apart** from each other so as to visually convey the sense of mind-numbing slowness. And because the music doesn't inspire anyone to come up a cool custom design, Funeral Doom bands often have to settle for a **wordmark** with some **decorative curls** that are really only there to signal to the eyes that this or that letter is still very much part of the name and logo.

<a name="psychedelic"></a> 
## Stoner Metal
Because of its slow droning nature, Doom Metal and stoner culture go together like a herb grinder and a glass bong. And so a new genre was born, whose lyrics are often about getting stoned and tripping on acid-laid Kool-Aid.

Logo-wise, nothing quite says stoner and psychedelia like a **hazy** or **cloud-like** Death Metal logo. (No joke -- this one was actually made by mesh-transforming the Brutal Death logo.) To make it further clear that this music is good for intense couch-sitting and bong-ripping, **greens** and **purples** are often used.

<a name="sludge"></a> 
#### Sludge Metal 
Musically, Sludge Metal in many is like Stoner Metal, with the only real difference being that Sludge Metal is not about being happily stoned. Quite the opposite, in fact -- its tunes ooze a decadent and depressive atmosphere. In that it's more like the aural equivalent of a bad trip.

In terms of logos, Sludge Metal rather shares similarities with Post-Metal. But this leads to the problem that these logos could look like anything from **hand-lettered comics-type** logos to **contemporary pseudo-art nouveau** logos to **Melodic Death Metal-styled** wordmarks. No, that's not completely true across the board. If it looks like it was drawn by a Parkinson's patient sitting on top a spinning wachine machine -- it's more likely to be a Sludge logo.

<a name="gothic"></a> 
# Gothic Metal
Gothic Metal is a broadly defined genre, comprising of two main subgenres: on the one hand there's bands that grew out of the Death-Doom genre, favoring gloomy, introspective atmosphere over outward bombast, and on the other hand there's melodic symphonic bands that emerged instead from the more uplifting Power Metal. Below is an example of the former. 

It probably speaks for itself: the lettering style is inspired by a **Gothic** -- which is basically synonymous with **blackletter** -- type. Of course, the astute reader will have noticed that everyone and their mom has blackletter(-inspired) wordmarks for logos. This is indeed a problem for whoever plays in the Gothic genre. The only recourse is to one-up the others by going all-in on the Gothic with yet further **Gothic flourishes**, regardless of whether they add anything of value to the design.

<a name="avantgarde"></a> 
# Avant-Garde Metal
The term "avant-garde" is often used synomously with "sophisticated." And, certainly, this label holds true for (most) bands playing in this nebulous genre that compromises a range of different (sub)genres. In fact, it comprises of so many heterogenous (sub)genres that "avant-garde" as a genre label has very little meaning aside from, "These guys and gals *really* know how to play their instruments!"

Funnily enough however, whilst avant-garde bands most likely, definitely, absolutely display technical virtuosity, they tend to have the least inspired, let alone sophisticated, logos. More than often they have **plain wordmarks**. Even more damning is that they seemingly always have an inexplicable preference for the **Abaddon type** (or something very close to it). But maybe it just came with their Angelfire website and they decided to stick with it ever since.

<a name="post"></a> 
## Post-Metal
Judging by its name you'd think bands in this genre have taken things to the Next Level Beyond Metal. In a way, they have. Seeing what these guys and gals are doing -- it's all very ambitious, it's the next level for the Metalhead who wants to be intellectually challenged. While the plebs are still gushing over **Immolation**'s latest simultaneous(!) callous-shredding guitar leads and legato melodic lines and reveling in **Cannibal Corpse**'s lyrics about necrogenic ressurections, Post-Metallers rather choose to set the tastes of the "thinking man," exploring textures and timbre.

If you're not sure what you're listening to is Post-Metal -- wait until the lyrics kick in. What few there are, are typically interspersed with lecture recordings of Jacques Derrida or more often Michel Foucault. 

A Post-Metal logo could be anything from a casual wordmark to a hand-lettered logo with a more custom and unique feel. Regardless of novelty, post-metal logos all have the same letter treatment: they all look like they're **dissolving** or **fading**. Now, mind you, they're not fading out of existence, they're just moving to a higher plain -- and they encourage you to follow them -- to the heights of Reason and Illumination.

And if the band name consists of several words, the words are set in diferent sizes of type and placed at different heights from the baseline.

## Funk Metal
Funk Metal takes the conventional riffing of Heavy Metal and blends it with a Funk sensibility, and that's really all there is to it.

# Faux Metal
If you were born in a white, well-off family in the 1980s or 1990s, chances are you never were into *real*, authentic Metal. While the others were exchanging albums of **Immortal**, **Marduk**, **Nailbomb**, and **Sepultura**, you were probably busy skating in your Droors jeans to the tunes of **Korn**, **Deftones**, and **Coal Chamber**. You probably stood looking surprised, unable to believe that your long-haired classmate just said no to what you thought was a rhetorical question -- "Don't you just wish they had **Limp Bizkit** do a version of *this*!" I hate to break it to you, but you were a poser!

<a name="nu"></a> 
## Nu Metal
I'd rather not waste any words discussing an unseemly genre as Nu Metal, but for clarity's sake, here's what Nu Metal is: it's an eclectic genre that blends elements from Alternative and Groove Metal and a myriad of other styles as well, including but not limited to, Industrial, Hip-Hop, and Funk; vocal styles range from melodic whining to white boy's rap and hysterical screaming; lastly, occasionaly turntables and sampling are given more weight than the guitars -- you know, those things whose sound is what give meaning to the term "Heavy Metal."

And what is there to say about Nu logos that has not yet been said by now? They are **puerile in design** and **clumsily drawn**. To its credit in that respect, they convey well what the music is all about.

<a name="metalcore"></a> 
## Metalcore
Metalcore is another one of those "negative synergy" fusion genres that combines the worst elements of extreme metal and hardcore punk. Still it's what all the cool kids -- and only kids -- are listening to these days so I don't know. (Really, don't ask me why. I'm probably getting old.)

Anyway, the design process of a Metalcore logo can best be described as follows: After a band commissions you to do a logo, you do some preliminary sketching, to get a feel of the band's name, and at some point you probably send them out for approval. Now usually these **preliminary sketches** serve both as the scaffolding upon which the definitive lettering is superimposed and as a guide for any additional typographic style information. But with Metalcore logos, you leave the sketches **"as is."** There is no further work done on the logo.

FUNK METAL
bands hoping to be the next big thing
employs the distinctive sound of fun, conventional riffing is similar to 1980s thrash metal (red hot chili peppers, living color, primus, rage against the machine)

Alternative metal: combining traditional heavy with melodic vocals and other unconventional sounds, structures, and approaches


After all, Death Metal didn't emerge in isolation, but developed in part out of Thrash in the mid-1980s, and so naturally some bands will fall somewhere on the spectrum between the two. Doom, as we know it today, too, emerged in the mid-1980s and -- well, what is Doom really but Death Metal but played very slowly?
