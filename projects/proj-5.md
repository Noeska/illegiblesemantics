<!-- A historical perspective on metal logo design by Gerrit Rijken -->

Almost twenty years ago I started doing logos for bands -- first as a hobby and then in an ever more professional way. Throughout all these years I've never really wondered why things are done the way are done. This changed when we began working on our paper. I got intrigued and started to think about it. Drawing upon various resources and interviews, I've been slowly piecing together a timeline that details the coming into being of a visual code. 

While work on this timeline is far from complete and may have many names and logos added, it probably (and hopefully) already puts some things into perspective.

*Full disclosure: I know well that other authors (most notably, Mark Riddick and Christophe Szpajdel) have already put out books that deal with this very subject, but I have yet to read those. So, yes, this may well be a pointless, self-indulgent waste. But perhaps it will contribute to a better understanding of global Extreme Metal aesthetics. So I will continue digging ...*

# The Early Years

## 1970
Heavy Metal's origins are generally understood to have started with Black Sabbath with their 1970 self-titled debut.<sup>1</sup> At the time, they had what appears to be a **wordmark** (i.e. a type-only) logo -- nothing too fancy, nothing too plain.

## 1971
One year later, they had changed their logo to the one we know today. 

> "The bubbly letterforms of the logo that appeared on the band's eponymous debut look more hallucinatory than creepy. It is a distant cousin to the aggressive wordmarks seen today."

> "Typography, that stuff sort of starts off as psychedelic."

# Things Are Getting Extreme

## 1981
#### NWOBHM
**Venom** releases *In League with Satan*. The logo on the cover is a custom, hand-drawn design by Conrad Lant (a.k.a. Cronos), the driving force behind the band. The letters have **rounded edges with no sharp corners**. 

According to Christophe Szpajdel, the designer behind the seminal **Emperor** logo, the Venom logo (or the updated version, perhaps) was one of his main inspirations. 

<!-- Grim Reaper releases *Bleed 'em Dry*. The logo on the cover is a plain blackletter wordmark. -->

## 1982
Sometime during 1981-82, **Venom** has updated their logo: the **letters are less bubbly** and the **serifs have been sharpened**.

#### Thrash Metal
**Metallica** released their demo, *No Life 'Til Leather*. The logo on the cover displays the name with the **first and last letter drawn larger with sharp serifs** and italicized. It was designed by James Hetfield himself.

**Destruction** is formed. They now, or wil soon, have a **blackletter wordmark** for a logo.

## 1983 
#### Thrash Metal
**Armored Saint** is formed. They, too, have a **blackletter wordmark**, but with an added **calligraphic curl**. It is one of Szpajdel's inspirations.

**Slayer** releases *Show No Mercy*.

> "Even if you've never heard a song by Slayer, the seminal thrash metal band that came out of Southern California in 1981, you could make an educated guess about the kind of music they play simply by looking at their logo. The wordmark, first seen on the 1983 album *Show No Mercy*, features clean, angular letters that interweave with a pentagram of swords. It looks harsh and dangerous, like a graphical lightning bolt that's striking too close for comfort."
