<!-- A historical perspective on metal logo design by Gerrit Rijken -->

Almost twenty years ago I started doing logos for bands -- first as a hobby and then in an ever more professional way. Throughout all these years I've never really wondered why things are done the way are done. This changed when we began working on our paper. I got intrigued and started to think about it. Drawing upon various resources and interviews, I've been slowly piecing together a timeline that details the coming into being of a visual code. 

While work on this timeline is far from complete and may have many names and logos added, it probably (and hopefully) already puts some things into perspective.

*Full disclosure: I know well that other authors (most notably, Mark Riddick and Christophe Szpajdel) have already put out books that deal with this very subject, but I have yet to read those. So, yes, this may well be a pointless, self-indulgent waste. But perhaps it will contribute to a better understanding of global Extreme Metal aesthetics. So I will continue digging ...*
