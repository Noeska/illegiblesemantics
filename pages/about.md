## Abstract
The logos of metal bands are by turns sometimes gaudy, uncouth, or nearly illegible. Yet, these logos work: they communicate sophisticated notions of genre and emotional affect. In this paper we use the design considerations of metal logos to explore the space of “illegible semantics”: the ways that design can communicate information while still being unreadable. In this work, drawing on formative visualization theory, professional design expertise, and empirical assessments of a corpus of metal band logos, we present a design space of metal logos. We use this design space to investigate how we as designers can communicate without communicating, and discuss how these illegible semantics are or could be reflected in the wider information visualization domain.
